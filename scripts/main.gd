class_name RendererMain
extends SceneTree
## Single entry point of the renderer. Run under a display driver (the GPU needs one, see docker/entrypoint.sh):
##   godot --path . -- <command> [options]
## project.godot names this class in application/run/main_loop_type, because the release export template the
## image runs ignores -s. The template also refuses to start without a main scene, so main.tscn is an empty one.
## With the editor binary, `-s scripts/main.gd` works as well.
##
##   render      render tile rectangles to PNG/WebP files (debugging, comparison with reference images)
##   scan        world scan cache (cx, cz, min_y, max_y per chunk)
##   run         whole-map job: plan, render and upload one map, then rebuild its zoom levels
##   watch       resident updater: keeps every map of a config current around the chunks the server saves
##   zoom        rebuild zoom-out levels without rendering
##   build-data  extract blocks, models, textures and biomes from a Minecraft client jar
##   shot        one perspective picture of a map (PNG + camera transform), see docs/render-api.md
##   dev         debugging helpers (dump, column, topblocks, colblocks, encodetest, zoomtest)
##
## Options are `--key value` or `--flag`; see each command's class for the full list.
